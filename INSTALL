YETI INSTALLATION NOTES
-----------------------
The following sections describe how to install and run YETI.


Dependencies
------------
YETI requires Python 2.7 and leverages the following external libraries:
+ Django v1.5.x (http://www.djangoproject.com)
+ pyOpenSSL (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyOpenSSL)
+ libtaxii (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/libtaxii) 1.1.101 or higher
  - lxml (http://lxml.de/index.html#download)
  - libxml2 2.9.0 or higher (http://www.xmlsoft.org/downloads.html)
  - python-dateutil 1.5 or later (http://labix.org/python-dateutil)

To install these dependencies, we recommend using the pip utility (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip),
which will download and install these libraries along with any of their dependencies:

$ pip install django libtaxii pyOpenSSL

NOTE: Windows users may not be able to install some dependencies (e.g., libxml2, pyOpenSSL, etc.)
via pip due to compilation issues. Please refer to the dependency websites (linked above) for 
Windows executable installer options should pip fail.

Deployment
----------
YETI is a Django web application that can be installed and run via several different methods.
The recommended way to easily stand up and use YETI is via the quickstart script located in
the scripts directory.


Quickstart
----------
To install and run YETI, users can take advantage of the quickstart script found within the
scripts directory of your YETI base directory. The quickstart.sh script is intended to be run
within Linux or OSX environments, while the quickstart.bat script can be run within a Windows
environemnt. To start YETI, follow these steps:

1) In a shell, navigate to the your YETI base directory
2) Run the quickstart script (quickstart.sh in Linux/OSX or quickstart.bat in Windows)
   
   $ ./scripts/quickstart.sh # on Linux/OSX
   > scripts\quickstart.bat  # on Windows
   
3) Type "yes" and press Enter when prompted to create a superuser account
4) Enter a username when prompted
5) Enter an email address when prompted
6) Enter a password when prompted
7) Enter password again when prompted
8) Open a web browser and enter http://127.0.0.1:8080 in the URL bar

You should be presented with a YETI welcome page that details the available services of your
YETI installation. Once YETI is running, you can interact with it via the inbox_client.py, 
discovery_client.py, and poll_client.py scripts found within the scripts directory.


WSGI
----
Django web applications can be run as a WSGI app from within an HTTP server implementation
such as Apache HTTP Server v2.2. Documentation on how to accomplish this can be found on
the Django documentation website (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/wsgi/)
or on the YETI wiki page (https://github.com/TAXIIProject/yeti/wiki/Apache-2.2-Deployment).


Administration
--------------
Administration of YETI (e.g., adding user accounts, seeing/modifying stored data, etc.) can
be accomplished via the admin interface, located at 127.0.0.1:8080/admin. You will be asked to
enter the superuser credentials entered previously when starting YETI for the first time.
